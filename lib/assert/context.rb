  class Context

    # a Context is a scope for tests to run in.  Contexts have setup and
    # teardown blocks, subjects, and descriptions.  Tests are run in the
    # scope of a Context instance.  Therefore, a Context should have
    # no base logic/methods/instance_vars.  The instance should remain
    # pure to not pollute test scopes.

    # if a class subclasses Context, add it to the suite
    def self.inherited(klass)
      Assert.suite << klass

    # put all logic here to keep context instances pure for running tests
